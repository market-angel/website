			<h2>
				Video Games
			</h2>

			<p>
				I have made some video games. 
				To be honest, the ones I have made aren't very good, but I have learned a lot from making them. 
				I started wanting to do this ever since I had to make a scratch game in 6th grade.
				This may have begun my interest in coding as a whole.
				It may have also inspired my interest in computer programs and such.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Story
			</h2>

			<p>
				I believe I began making books in first grade.
				I may share these in the future, if I can find them.
				Honestly, I don't think they were that bad considering how old I was.
				I had someone who would help me write them, but I can't remember who they were.
				We would distribute the books for kids to read in class, and I remember them being quite hilarious.
				Eventually I moved to 2nd grade, which was a new school and all my friends were gone once again. If I even had any, I can't remember.
				It was around this time when Derpy Studios was born (not the YouTube channel, the corporation)
				Yes, I made kids at my school the "employees" and made them give me ideas.
				And then this basically carried on until now, where I'm trying to piece together my own timeline, which has gone way further than I anticipated.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Art
			</h2>

			<p>
				I was always interested in art. 
				I may not have always been very good at it, but I enjoyed creating things.
				Recently I have been experimenting with different styles.
				Hopefully my art is good.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Music
			</h2>

			<p>
				I have never really been very good at making music, nor have I had any interest until recently.
				I guess I'll see how it goes, I seem to enjoy it.
